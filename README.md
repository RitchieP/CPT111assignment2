# CPT111assignment2
This is a project for my University assignment. It is about a simple restaurant menu and ordering system.

Greetings, this is a file which is used to describe how my code works.

My program first starts off by inputting stocks for every menu in the restaurant.
No matter which user you choose (manager or customer) the program will prompt you
to input the stocks first.

Then the program will prompt you to choose between customer or manager.

For customer, the program will ask for your order then make payment.
You are allowed to make multiple orders in one receipt.
The program will then calculate price and estimated delivery time.

For manager, the program will ask you to either update the menu or see statistics.
You are able to update the menu name, price and delivery time.
Statistics will show you the numbers of customer, total sale, most popular burger
and etc.

***If the program keeps showing "Invalid selection"***
This is most probably because the program asks you for a integer input but you
typed in a character. The program will need to restarted.
